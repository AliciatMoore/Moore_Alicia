			<p>Chinese New Year,[2] also known as the "Spring Festival" (simplified Chinese 春节; traditional Chinese 春節; Pinyin: Chūn Jié) in modern Mainland China, is an important Chinese festival celebrated at the turn of the traditional lunisolar Chinese calendar. Celebrations traditionally run from the evening preceding the first day, to the Lantern Festival on the 15th day of the first calendar month. The first day of the New Year falls on the new moon between 21 January and 20 February.[3] In 2017, the first day of the Chinese New Year was on Saturday, 28 January, initiating the year of the Rooster.[4]

The New Year festival is centuries old and gains significance because of several myths and customs. Traditionally, the festival was a time to honor deities as well as ancestors.[5] Chinese New Year is celebrated in countries and territories with significant Chinese populations, including Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore,[6] Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Mauritius and Australia,[7] and the Philippines.[8][9] Chinese New Year is considered a major holiday for the Chinese and has had influence on the lunar new year celebrations of its geographic neighbours.

Within China, regional customs and traditions concerning the celebration of the Chinese New Year vary widely. Often, the evening preceding Chinese New Year's Day is an occasion for Chinese families to gather for the annual reunion dinner. It is also traditional for every family to thoroughly cleanse the house, in order to sweep away any ill-fortune and to make way for good incoming luck. Windows and doors will be decorated with red color paper-cuts and couplets with popular themes of "good fortune" or "happiness", "wealth", and "longevity". Other activities include lighting firecrackers and giving money in red paper envelopes. Among about one third of the Mainland population, or 500 million Northerners, dumplings (especially those of vegetarian fillings) feature prominently in the meals celebrating the festival.

It is one of the world's most prominent and celebrated festivals, with the "largest annual mass human migration in the world".</p>

		<article>
			<header>
				<h3>Introduction</h3>
			</header>
			<p>The Tuen Ng or Duanwu Festival, also often known, especially in the West, as the Dragon Boat Festival, is a traditional holiday originating in China, occurring near the summer solstice. It is also known as Zhongxiao Festival (Chinese: 忠孝節; pinyin: Zhōngxiàojié), commemorating fealty and filial piety. The festival now occurs on the 5th day of the 5th month of the traditional Chinese calendar, which is the source of the festival's alternative name, the Double Fifth Festival.[5] The Chinese calendar is lunisolar, so the date of the festival varies from year to year on the Gregorian calendar. In 2014, it fell on June 2; in 2015, on June 20; and in 2016, it occurred on June 9.</p>

				<h3>Introduction</h3>
			</header>
			<p>The Mid-Autumn Festival (traditional Chinese: 中秋節; simplified Chinese: 中秋节; Vietnamese: tết Trung Thu) is a harvest festival celebrated by ethnic Chinese and Vietnamese people.[1][2] The festival is held on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar with full moon at night, corresponding to late September to early October of the Gregorian calendar with full moon at night.[1]

Mainland China listed the festival as an "intangible cultural heritage" in 2006 and a public holiday in 2008.[1] It is also a public holiday in Taiwan, and in Hong Kong. In the Vietnamese culture, it is considered the second-most important holiday tradition after Tết.[citation needed]</p>
